# Time Haunting
This is a personal project, which is a console based game.
There are currently 3 types of players Fighter, Wizard, and Speaker.
Fighter can use Weapons and have more armor.
Wizards can use spells and have a little more inventory.
Speakers have a lot more luck in conversation, leading to cheaper prices and better trading, but also have a lot more inventory by default.
